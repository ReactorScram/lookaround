Cool ideas that can be done but probably won't be.

- Advertise TCP services in server response
- Arbitrary TCP forwarding of (stdin? stdout? TCP?) with interface cutover
- Netcat replacement "Just send a file" _including filename_
- Public-key crypto for trusting peers on first use (Hard cause it requires mutable disk state)
