Cool ideas that can be done but probably won't be.

- Exit faster if the user only wants to see known servers
- Command for shell substituting IPs into commands
- Arbitrary TCP forwarding of (stdin? stdout? TCP?)
- Netcat replacement "Just send a file" _including filename_
- Public-key crypto for trusting peers on first use (Hard cause it requires mutable disk state)
